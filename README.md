# Recursion

Demonstrates basic recursion and then recursion used with Linked Lists

Part1: File: chart.cpp
Write a program that displays a horizontal bar chartusing two recursive functions:
- hyphen function displays a bar of n hyphens(-)
- chart function uses hyphen function to generate the chart for passed data

Part2: assign4.cpp, LinkedList.h
Using your previous Linked List homework, add the following recursive member functions and demonstrate them in assign4.cpp

•A recursive function that prints the list in order.
•A recursive function that prints the list in reverse order.
•A recursive function that prints the value of every other node in the list in order.
•Arecursive function that returns the number of nodes in the list.
•A Boolean function that implements the recursive version of sequential search.
